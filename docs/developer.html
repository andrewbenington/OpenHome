        <h1>Technical Information for Developers</h1>
        <h2>Electron Framework</h2>
        <p>
          OpenHome is built with <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> to allow for
          compatibility with Linux, macOS, and Windows devices. Electron also provides the ability
          to prompt for updates, and to use a Node.js "backend" to interact with the operating
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Electron apps have the downside of taking up more space than native apps, as they are
          complete web browsers under the hood. The benefits of full Linux/macOS/Windows support
          currently outweighs the downsides of Electron, as I don't want users to be restricted to a
          single platform, and native development for three operating systems would take more time
          than I have.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the app gains enough users, I plan to migrate to React Native at some point in the
          future, which would not only provide a smaller app size and better performance, but would
          also make a mobile app version possible, all while keeping the TypeScript codebase.
        </p>
        <h2>TypeScript</h2>
        <p>
          TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, adding static typing and a type checker.
          TypeScript code transpiles to JavaScript and is not run by itself (with rare exception).
          The reason I and many others use TypeScript instead of pure JavaScript is because static
          typing adds many desirable features to a codebase:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            More mistakes can be caught during development that would otherwise occur at runtime
          </li>
          <li>
            Code is self-documenting. Without the need for comments, a developer knows what to
            expect a function will receive and return.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refactoring is safer and easier. If, for example, a function's arguments or return types
            are changed, TypeScript will alert the developer to any code where the old type
            signature is still expected and will cause issues.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          People much smarter than me have debated the merits of static typing since before I was
          born. Ultimately, I believe TypeScript saves more time down the line than it requires
          upfront by avoiding bugs that would have been caught with a static type system.
        </p>
        <h2>JavaScript/TypeScript Modules</h2>
        <p>
          Some parts of the code have been split into their own modules. This is to promote better
          code structure, with low
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)">coupling</a> and a
          smaller codebase for the application itself. These modules are also available for
          developers of other Pokémon-related JavaScript and TypeScript projects who might want to
          interface with Pokémon files and data.
