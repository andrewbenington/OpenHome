        <h1>Technical Information for Developers</h1>
        <h2>Tauri Framework</h2>
        <p>
          OpenHome is built with <a href="https://tauri.app//">Tauri</a> to allow for compatibility
          with Linux, macOS, and Windows devices. Tauri uses a Rust "backend" to interact with the
          operating system. Other Tauri features that might be used by the app in the future include
          in-app updates and the possibility of a mobile app
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenHome previously used Electron, which provided more consistency across platforms with
          the drawback of a larger app size and slightly worse performance. Electron also doesn't
          support mobile app releases, which is a future goal for OpenHome.
        </p>
        <h2>TypeScript</h2>
        <p>
          TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, adding static typing and a type checker.
          TypeScript code transpiles to JavaScript and is usually not run on its own. The many
          developers use TypeScript instead of pure JavaScript is because static typing adds many
          desirable features to a codebase:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            More mistakes can be caught during development that would otherwise occur at runtime
          </li>
          <li>
            Code is self-documenting. Without the need for comments, a developer knows what to
            expect a function will receive and return.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refactoring is safer and easier. If, for example, a function's arguments or return types
            are changed, TypeScript will alert the developer to any code where the old type
            signature is still expected and will cause issues.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          People much smarter than me have debated the merits of static typing since before I was
          born. Ultimately, I believe TypeScript saves more time down the line than it requires
          upfront by avoiding bugs that would have been caught with a static type system.
        </p>
        <h2>JavaScript/TypeScript Modules</h2>
        <p>
          Some parts of the code have been split into their own modules. This is to promote better
          code structure, with low
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)">coupling</a> and a
          smaller codebase for the application itself. These modules are also available for
          developers of other Pokémon-related JavaScript and TypeScript projects who might want to
          interface with Pokémon files and data.
