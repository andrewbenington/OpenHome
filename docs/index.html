          <span class="openhome-name">OpenHome</span> is an open source tool for moving Pokémon
          between game save files, including forwards and backwards through generations, without
          data loss.
        </p>

            <p>
              When a Pokémon is moved into a save file, its data from other games is saved locally,
              so nothing is lost when transferring to past generations.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a Sceptile with the Kalos Champion ribbon can be moved from Pokémon X to
              Pokémon Ruby, earn the Artist Ribbon, and it will have both the Kalos Champion and
              Artist ribbons when moved back to Pokémon X.

              When moving Pokémon to an older game, some compromises have to be made. OpenHome will
              try its best to preserve aspects of a Pokémon such as its nature, ability, gender, and
              shininess, all of which are usually possible minus some specific cases in the GameBoy
              games. These compromises will be reverted when moving back to a future game.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a Pokémon originating in Generation 6 being moved into a Generation 3
              game will have its personality value altered to preserve its nature, ability (if
              possible), gender, and shininess.
            </p>
            <p>
              A Pokémon transferred into Generation 1 or 2 will have it's Original Trainer's ID
              changed to a "tracking number" of sorts due to the lack of a Personality Value in
              those games.

              Development is ongoing. While OpenHome does its best to convert Pokemon between
              formats losslessly, there are sometimes mistakes. It's always a good idea to back up
              your save files.
            </p>
            <p>
              All PKM formats from Generations I-IX are currently supported. All game save files
              from Generations I-IX are supported, except for:
